##** Computational thinking / critical thinking for problem solving.
# Abstraction: breaking down big problems to smaller problems and selecting data structures and algorithms to solve problems.

##** Precision and Abstraction
Start with abstraction and then refine the solution.

##** Tools

1. Install a command prompt if not included with the OS.

2. Use Git.

    1. Version control
    2. There is the remote and local reopositories, where the local one is downloaded to your device. You will need to pull
        to synchronize with other collaborators and push your own changes.
    3. Branch from a node and then you can merge it back with the original.
    4. Rever to older verions of code.

    ##** git clone
    # makes a copy of the remote repo to your local repo. 
    # You can also "fork" someone elses remote repo which creates a copy for yourself.


    ##** git add <filename>
    # Adds the file to the "staging area," when commit is executed these files will be included in the new version.
    # git add *   -- will add all changed files.



3. Use an IDE, like VS code.

4. Host a website.
    4.1. Static
        1. pages.github.com
        2. netlify.com
    
    4.2. Full fledge.
        1. amazon.com/education/awseducate
        2. azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students
        3. cloud.google.com/edu/students
        4. education.github.com/pack

5. Help resources.
    1. reddit.com/r/learnprogramming
    2. r/programming
    3. stackoverflow.com
    4. serverfault.com
    5. techcrunch.com
    6. news.ycombinator.com


##** Emoji
Controlled by Unicode which has companies that have voting rights.

Unify characters (inlcuding emojis) into standard codes so all devices can use them.
Since each character has an unique binary representation and it correlates with what character on your device.
On each device with a OS, the character may not be exactly the same but close enough.

An innovation is Zero Width Joiner, ZWJ, to combine emojis so that the device's OS can take the original emoji and then 
    apply the modifications to it and then display. This is better than creating a unique binary code for a entirely new
    emoji. 

    E.g. A brown hand emoji. On the sender phone they see the same emoji with different skin color and they can choose
    which one to send. When sent, the emoji is ZWJ with multiple parts, say that this one is the default hand emoji, which is
    yellow, and "plus" the color brown. Once received it recognized this is ZWJ and combines the parts and displays it.

    So, now you just have 1 hand emoji and say 10 colors, instead of having to assign 10 hand emojis to 10 different codes.
    
    Another example is the "polar bear" emoji and actually just "default bear emoji" "plus" "snow emoji" behind the scenes.
