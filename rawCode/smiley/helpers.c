How do you think you represent a black pixel when using a 24-bit color BMP file?    0, 0, 0
Is this the same or different when mixing paints to repesent various colors?    Opposite of mixing paint.

/*
Your program should behave per the examples below.

smiley/ $ ./colorize smiley.bmp smiley_out.bmp
When your program is working correctly, you should see a new file, smiley_out.bmp in your smiley directory.
Open it up and see if the black pixels are now the color youâ€™ve specified.
